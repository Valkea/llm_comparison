I had to do the earliest show, and it was one thing waking up so early to do a 6am shift, let alone the teachers taking out the needles for the records, so I couldn't play anything and had to talk.\n",

      "###### agent_1 How are you? Do you watch Football at all? Charles Snowden recently led the VA Cavaliers over Louisville\n",
      "###### agent_2 I can't say that I am much of a football fan. It seems like a very different game depending on where in the world it is played though. \n",
      "###### agent_1 Yea, I guess in the US it's known as gridiron around the world. I guess Snowden is a good player in basketball too\n",
      "###### agent_2 Strange that he would play both. They seem like they would require drastically different sports skills. \n",
      "###### agent_1 Yea but I guess it doesn't matter as much at the college level, plus he played basketball for Coach O.J. Johnson who use to play football as well\n",
      "###### agent_2 A good coach makes all the difference in the world. I am surprised that more former pros don't coach especially since they really don't make as much money as people tend to think they do. \n",
      "###### agent_1 I guess most former players aren't into recruiting players, I know VA coach had to rebuild his football program, must of been stressful\n",
      "###### agent_2 Stressful but lucrative if you are good at what you do. The sponsers seem to want to follow pros that have had good careers. Especially if they are known for something like highest rushing yards or biggest lineman or never fumbling. \n",
      "###### agent_1 Yea but coaching wasn't always lucrative, at least not in the 1960s, the top bowlers made twice as much as the top football players\n",
      "###### agent_2 I wonder if that is because they have a longer career. It seems like with all the injuries that football players no matter where they are just can't keep going for long. \n",
      "###### agent_1 Probably has something to do with football not being as popular in the 1960s and individual bowlers probably made more money winning competitions\n",
      "###### agent_2 I feel bad for the players on teams that just aren't good. It isn't always the fault of the players either. Look at the superbowl this year. 13-3 is just bad. Of course not nearly as bad as the record holding 222-0 but still. \n",
      "###### agent_1 Yea 222-0 is pretty bad, I'm not surprised no one has come close to score as much as Georgia tech did back in 1916\n",
      "###### agent_2 At a certain point during a game like that you almost want to just call it. I would expect scores like that out of basketball games not football. \n",
      "###### agent_1 Yea but they had loopsided scores like that in basketball years ago. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was so dominant in college that they banned the dunk for over a decade because of him\n",
      "###### agent_2 I don't understand the love of the dunk. Yeah it looks sort of cool but the skill level is so much higher when it comes to 3 pointers. \n",
      "###### agent_1 Well I guess the dunk was pretty impressive when few people could actually reach the hoop 10 feet up\n",
      "###### agent_2 That's true. A good vertical is important in basketball. I wonder if they lower the hoop in WNBA or if the women are dunking at the same level. \n",
      "###### agent_1 I don't know the exact stats but im pretty sure the hoop is lower than the NBA's 10 feet and the diameter is larger than 18 inches\n",
      "###### agent_2 It seems like it depends on where in the world the games are located. I think in America it is more about showmanship than game skills necessarily. \n",
      "###### agent_1 Probably. I wonder what it's like in New Zealand, they have a basketball team nicknamed the \"tall blacks\" lol\n",
      "###### agent_2 Seems a bit risky to say that given the racial tensions of the day. But if they gave themselves that knickname it isn't so bad. \n",
      "****************\n",
      "###### agent_1 Football or Basketball, do you have a favorite?\n",
      "###### agent_2 Football! It's more exciting I think. I like the american version though!\n",

      "****************\n",
      "###### agent_1 Hi. I didn't know that benjarvus green-ellis never had a fumble.  Impressive!\n",
      "###### agent_2 I know, right? I thought it was weird how the cheerleaders arent allowed to eat in the same restaurants as the nfl players.\n",
      "###### agent_1 yeah, that is bizarre.  Iowa's visiting locker room is pink.  Strange\n",
      "###### agent_2 I wonder if that was meant to try to demoralize the players\n",
      "###### agent_1 Seems like it would work lol.  \n",
      "###### agent_2 I was shocked that the highest score in a football game was 222... THATS CRAZY!\n",
      "###### agent_1 No doubt.  And the other team was shut out!  Also, bowlers used to make more than football players.  That's changed!\n",
      "###### agent_2 Yea it has... could you imagine if bowlers were paid more than nfl players now? They would make average 6-12 million a year for bowling lol\n",
      "###### agent_1 That'd be nuts!  An NFL game only has 11 minutes of gameplay...I never would have guessed that\n",
      "###### agent_2 I already knew that, which is why I get so frustrated with how long a game takes :(\n",
      "###### agent_1 Yeah, I can imagine that would be frustrating.  I usually only watch the super bowl and that game takes forever!\n",
      "###### agent_2 I thought it was pretty cool that the cat in the opening scene of the Godfather, was just a stray. Chances are that was an unplanned scene.\n",
      "###### agent_1 I'd bet that, too.  So, in asia you can pay to play with cats...now that's weird!\n",
      "###### agent_2 I think its a waste of money lol just get a cat\n",
      "###### agent_1 no doubt, cats are everywhere! \n",
      "###### agent_2 Everywhere including Alaska... where they are made mayors. Now thats weird lol\n",
      "###### agent_1 They also co-author physics papers!\n",
      "###### agent_2 Im not sure the actual purpose of either, but they are both pretty strange!\n",
      "###### agent_1 Yeah, I don't get it either lol.  Apparently cats just sleep for two-thirds of their lives anyway\n",
      "###### agent_2 yea, Im 35 right now... I couldn't imagine sleeping 12 years of that. No wonder cats are considered lazy lol\n",
      "###### agent_1 That's basically sleeping 16 hours a day...I cannot imagine that\n",
      "###### agent_2 I will say that I was pleased to see that at least an engineer has higher wages than an nfl or mlb player. I faithfully believe that sport players are WAY overpaid.\n",
      "###### agent_1 Considering how unimportant their jobs are, I agree.  Unfortunately they generate a ton of revenue sense people pay so much for tickets and merch.  Its all a waste IMO\n",
      "###### agent_2 Hugh waste! I think that a percentage of the earned income should automatically go to funding projects or foundations that better the citizens lives or economy. \n",
      "###### agent_1 I agree.  What kills me are the billionaire owners that cry poor when they want a new stadium,  No way that should be paid for by taxes.\n",

      "###### agent_1 Yep, that's true but seeing how big the guys are its no surprise that no woman has ever joined or wanted to join a team haha\n",
      "###### agent_2 I agree! And semi-related, I've heard that the University of Iowa's locker room for visiting football teams is completely painted pink! \n",
      "###### agent_1 Yeah, that a great way to decrease team moral haha\n",
      "###### agent_2 Exactly! Or maybe make the other team angry! In the 60's top bowlers made twice as much money as the top football stars!\n",
      "###### agent_1 Now that is weird to hear because of the big difference in physicalness.\n",
      "###### agent_2 Absolutely! I'm sure football pays more than bowling, these days! Ha. So, the highest score ever in a football game was in 1916! When Georgia Tech beat Cumberland 222-0!\n",

      "###### agent_1 Yes similar to my liked! I like all levels. There was a high school team that played despite their science building burning down in the background!\n",
      "###### agent_2 They did, you know  that there is a really expensive high school stadium in Texas, it has a cost of $60 million to get build\n",
      "###### agent_1 Wow that is a huge cost. Seems like the fans need to behave better in Philly. They have a court setup in the stadium!\n",
      "###### agent_2 They do? I wonder why, that is really strange\n",
      "###### agent_1 Yes because of their fans bad behavior!\n",

      "###### agent_1 Exactly. Wow that is impressive. College football is big. Tim Tebow was big in college but not so much the NFL. He was actually offered to play arena football by Kiss.\n",
      "###### agent_2 Not really sure who is Tim Bow but yeah, many great college players dissapoint later when the go to the NFL\n",

      "###### agent_1 I was unaware that the top bowlers in the 60s made as much as top football stars. \n",

      "###### agent_1 Yeah, crazy. ESPN won an emmy for the creation of the superimposed yellow line that represents the 1st down marker. \n",
      "###### agent_2 It's funny how it took so long for someone to think of something as simple as putting a yellow line for a first down took so long to be thought of\n",

      "###### agent_2 Yes, I had heard that before! I wonder how much money football players made in that time. I heard that in the 1960s it was only half as much as popular bowlers of the time.\n",
      "###### agent_1 Yeah, that fact surprised me a lot.  \n",
      "###### agent_2 I was also surprised to learn that ESPN won an Emmy for creating that yellow first down line graphic on television. I never realize that sports media could also win those Hollywood awards!\n",

      "###### agent_2 Can the Patriots keep it up forever, that's the key - I think the risks of football are a bit high, however. I'm glad Disney keeps at it. Of course Disneyland, all the hype and all the merchandise, makes movie-making well worth it.\n",

Musicians want to be athletes and athletes want to be musicians, so I guess he gets the best of both worlds. The second-best job for athletes is commentator, though, like those of a lot of football players.\n",

      "###### agent_2 I am surprised.  Football players (top ones) make much more money than bowlers now.\n",
      "###### agent_1 Yeah, people do really love their football. I don't really, maybe because there are only about 11 minutes of live gameplay per game.\n",
      "###### agent_2 Americans love NFL games. Do you know that it has 32 teams divided equally between NFC and AFC?\n",

      "###### agent_1 yea that rule forbidding cheerleader from the same place as football players is outdated and sexist\n",

      "###### agent_2 What about the problems with the NCAA though? The NFL needs the players.\n",
      "###### agent_1 I get that and it is valid, but it's like any sport.  If 1 person quits, there are 5 waiting to take their place.   If players don't want to play, then they should move along.\n",
      "###### agent_2 What about the fans though. People might get bored of a game when the quality goes down.\n",
      "###### agent_1 That is true.  Everything runs in cycles though.  I liken it to a losing team having an empty stadium and a winning team selling out.  Fans are fickle.  Their... our views are important, but we come and go.\n",
      "###### agent_2 I wonder whether letting women into the game would create interest, get more fans.\n",
      "###### agent_1 Oh, it absolutely would.  It would be like... and I know I am going to butcher the name here, but when Manon Reheaume played in the NHL.  My only concern is that if mishandled it might come off like a gimmick.\n",
      "###### agent_2 I see your point. Long term, will women stay? True.\n",
      "###### agent_1 I feel like... there are enough talented women athletes out there, that a woman kicker or QB is possible, perhaps a wide receiver.\n",
      "###### agent_2 Women can be tough too. Would a coach like Bill Belichick hire a woman if she could help him win the Super Bowl?\n",
      "###### agent_1 This is going to come off sounding bad, but it isn't meant to.  I think anyone in the front office would look at it from the perspective of generating revenue and views.  The sponsors would love the coverage.\n",
      "###### agent_2 Belichick has done well in the post season, so I think he's looking at it from a strategic point of view. The sponsors would tie her presence into a bunch of social issues and products.\n",
      "###### agent_1 Oh absolutely.  Belichek is looking at it from the right angle too.  He wants to win, that's what he is paid for.  I think the guy would hire a green Martian if he thought it would guarantee an extra TD.\n",
      "###### agent_2 Tom Brady and Belichick have done well together. I wonder how Brady would react to a woman in the huddle.\n",
      "###### agent_1 What a combo those two are.  While I'm not a huge fan of Brady, I do think that he is enough of a professional to be able to adapt if a scenario like that ever actually took place.\n",
      "###### agent_2 I wonder whether the male players would get jealous of the coverage she gets. If there is revenue sharing, they might not care because they make more $\n",
      "###### agent_1 I think they almost certainly will. It happened in NASCAR when Danica Patrick joined. Then after they get used to it, it will gradually get to be a normal thing. They will adapt to it.\n",
      "###### agent_2 Wow, she is awesome. The violence of the NFL is a bit different though. I wonder if the male players might be hesitant to smash her hard.\n",

      "###### agent_2 I think I have heard about that rule, it sounds so dumb.  I think it is time to have that rule removed to be honest. \n",
      "###### agent_1 I do too. The Saints should do better, if not for themselves, but for the good of the league.\n",

      "###### agent_1 I hate it because they are so good. Belichick is the winningest coach in post season history. \n",
      "###### agent_2 Yeah I know. I can't help but wonder if he cheats in some way.  On the ironic side though, they patriots are tied with the bills for the most losses at super bowls.\n",
      "###### agent_1 They are really good at thinking outside the box. Cheating or not. They let the giants score near the end of super bowl 46 so they would have a chance. Although it backfired on them\n",
      "###### agent_2 Did you know that Bill Belichick used to coach for the cleveland browns and that their last playoff win was when he was their coach?\n",
      "###### agent_1 Its his only playoff win not for the patriots. So crazy we could of had a browns dynasty instead\n",
      "###### agent_2 I know. We may still yet if Baker Mayfield has his way.  Football is so popular and important that it's hard to believe that back in the 1960's bowlers made more than football players.\n",
      "###### agent_1 Even more surprising is that the average life earnings of an engineer is higher than that of an nfl player\n",
      "###### agent_2 Now that is surprising.  I always assumed players were among the super rich.  I would think that Benjarvus Green-Ellis would especially be super rich.  He has never fumbled the ball in his career and he's a running back.\n",
      "###### agent_1 I wonder if they could use those tracking chips to learn how he never fumbled. That's very impressive\n",
      "###### agent_2 It really is and surprising. I had no idea until recently that the nfl put tracking chips in players shoulder pads.\n",
      "###### agent_1 It records a lot of stuff! they even use them in the balls themselves\n",
      "###### agent_2 I've heard that.  I guess that's how they knew Brady was cheating that time.  You know they do all of this studying and stuff and in reality a game only has 11 minutes of actual game playing.\n",
      "###### agent_1 That's really crazy. I wonder how much game time the 1916 game between Georgia tech and Cumberland had\n",
      "###### agent_2 Why, did that game last a really long time or something?\n",
      "###### agent_1 Yes, Georgia Tech set the highest score ever at 222\n",
      "###### agent_2 Oh my! i bet it did go on forever!  What was the other team's score?\n",
      "###### agent_1 Cumberland did not score. It must have been pretty embarrassing. There should have been a mercy rule\n",
      "###### agent_2 With that kind of score I definitely agree.  I guess Cumberland not only had no defense but no offense as well.\n",

      "###### agent_1 I dont follow him personally, but I have heard great things about him.\n",
      "###### agent_2 He's really good, Bill Belichick and Lawrence Taylor don't seem to think he compares to Taylor though.\n",
      "###### agent_1 Taylor is rather iconic, maybe over time their opinions might change.  Mack seems to be pretty talented, lets see if he stands the test of time.\n",
      "###### agent_2 I think he will. Taylor was a beast on the field though. I remember when he broke Joe Tehismann's leg on Monday Night Football.\n",
      "###### agent_1 Wow.  I dont remember that, but it sounds awful\n",
      "###### agent_2 Yeah, I think it was an accident, but still. \n",
      "###### agent_1 That is some serious power. I can see why there arent female football players, even though there is no rule against them.  I wouldnt want to be hit by that.\n",
      "###### agent_2 I agree with that. The average football players weigh, what 225 lbs? The average woman can't hold that kind of mass to protect themselves.\n",
      "###### agent_1 Plus they aren't exactly treating cheerleaders equitably.\n",
      "###### agent_2 Yeah, I heard that the Saints cheerleaders are forbidden from eating in the same restaurant as any NFL player and they even have to leave if a player come in while they're eating. That is ridiculous! \n",
      "###### agent_1 It really is, I wonder what happened to make that rule.\n",
      "###### agent_2 I don't know, it's kind of shady. \n",
      "###### agent_1 anyway, did you know Bellichick is the winningest coach in post season football, 21 wins!\n",
      "###### agent_2 Yeah, he's had 20 with the Patriots and 1 with the Browns. Has the browns had a playoff win since him?\n",
      "###### agent_1 Probably not.  Lol.  They're one of those historically bad teams. \n",
      "###### agent_2 Yeah they are. At least my Bills are on par with the Patriots...in Super Bowl losses. \n",
      "###### agent_1 LOL.  The Patriots will likely out do that soon, or maybe they will just win it every year for the rest of time  LOL\n",
      "###### agent_2 It's possible, I agree with the author of \"A Game of Thrones,\" they are the Lannisters of the NFL.\n",

      "###### agent_1 I would like some of football. I really like the Patriots, and I also think it's interesting how it is split between two conferences, the NFC and the AFC\n",
      "###### agent_2 The Seahawks almost beat the Patriots in one Super Bowl but did not because of a play call at the one yard line.\n",
      "###### agent_1 Yeah that's pretty crazy. I also think it's crazy that the NFL does not have a rule against female players, do you think we will ever see a female player?\n",

      "###### agent_1 Yeah, he was a first round draft pick by the Cowboys in 2010 but was cut in April. Ouch, that's gotta hurt.\n",
      "###### agent_2 His got impressive carreer thouhg, 531 catches, 73 touchdowns, all in 8 seasons\n",
      "###### agent_1 Yeah, he says that he still can play the game.\n",
      "###### agent_2 Maybe The Patriots can sign him, I heard they are having a tough time sigining a wide receiver, on that can be Edelmans replacement when his suspended or injured\n",
      "###### agent_1 Bryant turned down a three year offer from Baltimore in the spring because he thought he could get something better. I wonder if he regrets that.\n",
      "###### agent_2 I bet he does regret it, Baltimore is not the best team but they do alright and I think the pay is decent, it was a 3 year offer afterall sometimes greediness makes us take the wrong call.\n",

      "###### agent_2 i think pro football would have been better off if the nfl and the afl had not merged in 1966.\n",
      "###### agent_1 Yeah, but then the Bills would not be considered equal to the Patriots... in number of Superbowl losses.\n",
      "###### agent_2 only bill i know is bill belichick.\n",
      "###### agent_1 He is THE MAN!  You know, the last time the Browns won a playoff game was 1995. They beat the Patriots. And Belicheck was the coach of Cleveland then! \n",
      "###### agent_2 that is an interesting factoid, friend. i've heard some writer guy called the new england patriots the lannisters of the nfl. \n",
      "###### agent_1 Nice. I think we should cast Peter Dinklage as Bill Belichick in the movie.\n",
      "###### agent_2 only if he wins in the end. did you know that there is no rule that women can't be in the nfl? they only have to pass eligibility requirements.\n",
      "###### agent_1 Yeah, but the average NFL game is only 11 minutes of playing time. I know my wife wouldn't qualify because she is never less than 11 minutes late for anything.\n",
      "###### agent_2 well, with the average lifetime earning of an engineer being higher than the average lifetime earnings of an nfl player, i'd say you are better off.\n",
      "###### agent_1 I would encourage her to be a New Orleans cheerleader. That way she would not be allowed to eat with the football players. \n",
      "###### agent_2 hmmm i seem to recall they can eat the same thing, just not at the same place. \n",
      "###### agent_1 I guess I will fall back on plan B: I will install those NFL tracking chips in my wifes clothing. That way I can monitor the velocity, rotation, and location like the NFL does to their players.\n",
      "###### agent_2 sounds like a great plan to me!\n",
      "###### agent_1 And I hope to superimpose those virtual yellow lines in front of department stores too. I won't get an Emmy like ESPN did when they made them for TV, but I will be able to track my wife's yardage.\n",
      "###### agent_2 excellent plan. did you know that football codes can be traced back to the codification of football games at english public schools during the nineteenth century?\n",
      "###### agent_1 I did not. But I gave up codification as my new year's resolution. I was obsessed with it. I used to walk around muttering,  \"222-0, 222-0\". \n",
      "###### agent_2 that's a sound resolution, just like the patriots superbowl win\n",

      "###### agent_1 Hmmm, good question. He has done so much and considered the best quarterback of all time, so maybe. I think he is due some time to have some fun the rest of his life! The NFL probably won't want him to retire any time soon ,lol......\n",
      "###### agent_2 Not if they are smart. He is one of only 2 players in NFL history to have won 5 Super Bowls. Well, I guess it would be 6 now.\n",

      "###### agent_1 If you were to watch an NFL game it would only have 11 minutes of live gameplay on average.  \n",
      "###### agent_2 I watch football every weekend. That is probably accurate, I'm surprised that it is 11 minutes at all to be honest. \n",
      "###### agent_1 If you want a job that makes more in a lifetime than an average nfl player or mlb player you can become an engineer\n",
      "###### agent_2 I saw that, it is probably because there a bunch of players that last only a year or so. I'm not surprised, engineers make a lot of money. \n",
      "###### agent_1 If you were a bowler in the 1960's you could have made twice as much as top football stars too.\n",

      "###### agent_2 I sure do. Did you watch Tom Brady's record-settting superbowl performance?\n",
      "###### agent_1 I did. Don't you think it is funny there is only 11 minutes of gameplay\n",
      "###### agent_2 Yeah, and most of that is predictable.  The NFL uses tracking chips in equipment and balls to monitor everything, and all of this for 11 minutes per game...\n",
      "###### agent_1 I know. I wonder what info they collect with those\n",
      "###### agent_2 Ball speed, player location, etc. They also probably tracck player off the field too. In New Orleans, the cheerleaders are not allowed to dine with the players. How would they know unless they track them?\n",
      "###### agent_1 Yeah and the worst part is that they have to leave mid meal of the players come in\n",
      "###### agent_2 NFL has no written rule against female players, but don't let the eat together!\n",
      "###### agent_1 I know that just does not make sense at all. I wonder why they do that\n",
      "###### agent_2 The NFL can't brush it under the table iif a player beats up a cheerleader. They have to be on the field together the next week. SAD LOL  But TOm BRady's wife is a model and she makes more money than he does!\n",

      "###### agent_2 Oh, that's true. I don't think he's played all 16 games for a long time!\n",
      "###### agent_1 Yeah since like 2011 I think! But I'm sure Belichick will make the best decision as his coach.\n",
      "###### agent_2 Yeah, I'm not a huge fan of the Patriots, but I admit that Belichick knows what he's doing. Besides, Robert Kraft has said a lot of admirable things about Gronkowski.\n",
      "###### agent_1 Yeah and about Belichick too - he called him the greatest coach in the history of coaching. That's a pretty big compliment.\n",
      "###### agent_2 He is, but I guess it doesn't hurt to have Tom Brady on the team. Geez, I think he's one of only two NFL players to win 5 Super Bowls!\n",

      "###### agent_2 I don't know a lot of football, but it's pretty interesting the highest scoring game ever was in 1916.\n",
      "###### agent_1 Yeah, Cumberland was a real small school and got embarrassed for all of history.\n",
      "###### agent_2 I bet so. 222-0 is quite shameful!\n",

      "###### agent_1 I am not a big fan of the Patriots generally.\n",
      "###### agent_2 I think the Patriots cheat a lot. Would Belichick trade his best players though?\n",

      "###### agent_2 Where do you think Rob Gronkowski win end up? Do you think he wants to stay with the Pats?\n",
      "###### agent_1 I don't know much about him. Maybe he'll be more successful with a different team atmosphere.\n",
      "###### agent_2 How much money can he get though? He works well on the Pats. A change might make him less effective.\n",
      "###### agent_1 I agree, money-wise he'd be successful with the Pats. He seems like he cares a lot about atmosphere and attitude though. Do players often leave for those reasons or stay where they aren't appreciated? I'm not too familiar.\n",

      "###### agent_2 I think the inuries are catching up to him and affecting his play on the field and Bellichick sees that\n",

      "###### agent_2 I can't imagine seeing him or Brady in another uniform\n",

      "###### agent_2 Since the salary cap, Bellichick has mastered his roster and team year by year\n",
      "###### agent_1 Gronkowski has had health issues over the years and that is probably being taken into consideration.\n",
      "###### agent_2 Agreed, missing as many games as he has each year hurts his stock as a player\n",
      "###### agent_1 Opposing teams hate getting matched with him when he is fit though, making him indispensable some times.\n",
      "###### agent_2 I don't think you can question his competitiveness when he is on the field. He is a fierce competitor and is shows easily to everyone who watches him each week on the field\n",
      "###### agent_1 That is true. But his demeanor is carefree compared to the ruthlessness of Belichick and Brady.\n",
      "###### agent_2 Bellichick is given the freedom to make arguable decisions about the roster. Kraft does not question his decisions at all\n",
      "###### agent_1 Yes, it seems that Kraft really trusts him.\n",

      "###### agent_1 Don't know... That's amazing.  I graduated from Georgia Tech and never knew they beat Cumberland 222-0 in 1916.  \n",
      "###### agent_2 That is a huge defeat,  I can't imagine losing by that much.  Did you know theres a running back that played for the patriots who never fumbled the ball in his career?\n",
      "###### agent_1 Yeah, Mr. Green... I am grateful to ESPN for the yellow 1st down line.  It makes up for some of their political stunts...\n",

      "###### agent_1 cool. how was the game. i understand there is only 11 minutes of playtime but the game itself is really long\n",
      "###### agent_2 This was a very boring game.  Perhaps if they had had some women players - that is allowed in the NFL - it would have been more interesting\n",
      "###### agent_1 yeah i wonder why there are no women players considering they are allowed to play\n",
      "###### agent_2 New Orleans probably would not want them - they do not even allow their cheerleaders to eat at the same restaurant as the players.\n",
      "###### agent_1 or even worse, if the player walks in and they are eating they have to leave\n",
      "###### agent_2 That is pretty crazy.  They probably track the cheerleaders like they do the football during the game - with tracking chips\n",
      "###### agent_1 yeah at least I am sure they use the chips in the padding for better things likve tracking movement and statistics\n",
      "###### agent_2 It is funny - bowling is a less athletic sport but they used to make twice as much as football players\n",
      "###### agent_1 i think they now get paid more but not all of them\n",

      "###### agent_2 Interesting. I've never heard of that. Is that why it is pink? So they are cheaters? \n",
      "###### agent_1 Guess they're hoping it'll make the visiting team feel \"weaker\".  Do you think a woman could be a football player?  You know, technically, the NFL has no rules against it.\n",

      "###### agent_1 That's cool, the Broncos aren't the same without Peyton Manning though, in my opinion. \n",
      "###### agent_2 That's an understatement!  I mean, I know the QB is an important position, but losing one player like that shouldn't make the team crumble.\n",

      "###### agent_2 You'd think they would have pulled the QB at 60 - 0... What's the skunk rule?\n",
      "###### agent_1 I don't know but they should have done something different most definitely.  Maybe they just didn't value football like people do today.  Back in the sixties bowlers made more than football players.\n",
